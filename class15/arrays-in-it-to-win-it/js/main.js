//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
const movies = [
	'jurassic park',
	'the matrix',
	'the lord of the rings',
	'footloose',
];
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
const movieOne = movies[0];
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
const arraylength = movies.length;
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
const last = movies[movies.length - 1];
